`elevage` is a command-line tool that allows you to define an application
platform in a set of plain-text (YAML) configuration files and use those
definitions to provision the virtual machines on which the application will
live. The virtual machine will also be converged with the Chef runlists as
defined your configuration files.

Currently, `elevage` relies upon Chef's `knife` command and the `knife-vsphere`
plugin, and has been tested with various releases of Chef 11 and 12 as well
as the ChefDK.

#### External Dependencies

You must have the `knife` command installed on your path, and the
`knife-vsphere` plugin installed. Your options are to:

- Install [Chef Client](https://www.chef.io/download-chef-client/) and then
install `knife-vsphere` via Chef's embedded ruby's `gem`
- Install [ChefDK](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/) and then
`chef gem install knife-vsphere`
- Install Chef via rubygems with `gem install chef knife-vsphere`

#### Installation

elevage is distributed as a ruby gem

```bash
$ gem install elevage
```
## Usage

Create new, default platform definition files at current location. Comments within the template files describe necessary customizations.

```bash
$ elevage new <Platform Name>
```

Display parsed items from the desired state files.

```bash
$ elevage list <item>

list vcenter        :list all named vcenter definitions
list network        :list all named network definitions
list compute        :list all named compute configurations
list tiers          :list all defined tier names
list pools          :list all default component pool defintions
list components     :list all platform components
list environments   :list all defined environments
list <env name> -n  :display individual node names, IP addresses, and Chef roles
```

Check health of platform definition files.

```bash
$ elevage health
```

Generate a new environment file.  Comments within the template files describe necessary customizations.

```bash
$ elevage generate <environment name>
```

Provision nodes from platform and environment definition

```bash
$ elevage build <params>

Options:
  -a, [--all], [--no-all]                      # Build everything for the named environment
  -t, [--tier=TIER]                            # Build everything for the specified tier in the named environment
